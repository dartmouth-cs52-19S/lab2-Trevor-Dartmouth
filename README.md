### What I did
I made a buzzfeed style quiz where you answer some questions about your DDS preferences and it gives you which of the Dartmouth 7 you are (**note**: not actually scientifically proven)

#### What worked
* I had a really easy time working with flex boxes to make the initial css markup
* I really liked using jquery and javascript and I thought it really wimplified things
#### What didn't work
* I had a tough time working through all the hover effects and select states when I combined my css with javascript
* I had a difficult time getting my button listeners working after creating code dynamically from JSON

## Grading Notes
* I do not have a question header image as in an image above my question or in the question box. I thought this looked really ugly and I decided place my question header image as the background to the question (which differ for all questions). I confirmed that this was okay with multiple TA's, but I just want to let it be known in case one of those TA's is not grading my project. 
### Special things to point out
I chose to go the JSON route so these are some of the additional features that I added:

- Scrolling animation to the next question once an answer is selected
- A modal that displays the results of the quiz along with a picture
- A few transitions with the button hover and selection effects
- A try again button to allow the user to take the quiz multiple times
